== Overview

The ParkFlow Dashboard is a real-time visualization tool for parking entry events. It connects to a Kafka topic `parking.entry.events` and stores the data in DuckDB for efficient querying and visualization.

== Architecture

The dashboard consists of two main components:

1. Kafka to DuckDB Connector: Continuously reads from the Kafka topic and stores events in DuckDB
2. Dash Web Application: Visualizes the parking entry data with real-time updates

== Prerequisites

* Python 3.11+
* UV package manager
* Apache Kafka 3.8.0 (running in KRaft mode)
* Confluent Schema Registry

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies using UV
uv pip install -e ".[test]"
----

== Running the Dashboard

1. Start the Kafka to DuckDB connector:
+
[source,bash]
----
python -m parkflow_dashboard.kafka_duckdb_connector
----

2. Start the Dash application:
+
[source,bash]
----
python -m parkflow_dashboard.app
----

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:8050

== Testing

Run the tests with:

[source,bash]
----
pytest
----

This will also generate a coverage report. The minimum required coverage is 80%.
